Barbell-Toolbox
===============

Barbell Toolbox currently contains two tools:
Max Calculator: Calculates your one rep max based on how many reps you can do with a certain weight. If you can squat 300 for 6 reps, you can theoretically do 360 for one rep.

Plate Calculator: Tells you which plates you need on each side of the bar in order to make a particular weight. If you want to lift 270lbs, you would need 2 45's, 2 10's, and 1 2.5 on each side of the barbell.
